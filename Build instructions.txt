Dependencies

Squeezelite requires header files for the following libraries to be present at 
build time: * libasound2 * libflac * libmad0 * libvorbis * libfaad * libmpg123

All above libraries are dynamically loaded and optional at runtime, meaning that 
these libraries are only required on the build machine.

It also optionally supports the following libraries which may be enabled by 
defining additional build options: * libsoxr * libffmpeg

Build Options

Optional build options are enabled by passing additional defines to the compiler. 
This may be done with the -D option to ggc or via setting OPTS before calling the 
included makefiles. For example:

OPTS="-DFFMPEG -DRESAMPLE" make

The following build options are supported * PORTAUDIO - build with port audio 
support (on linux only, it is not optional on other platforms) * RESAMPLE - 
build with libsoxr support for real time upsampling * FFMPEG - build with FFMPEG 
support for wma and alac support. Note that this requires the binary to be run 
with FFMPEG library versions which match the header files used for compilation. 
This is necessary and the ffmpeg api changes between versions. 
* VISEXPORT - support export of audio data to jivelite for visualization support 
(linux only) * DSD - support of DSD playback via DOP (-D command line option) or 
conversion to pcm (requires LMS server patches)

Target Platforms

Squeezelite can be build with gcc on linux and osx platforms using the included 
makefiles. (use debian-i386, debian-x86_64 and minimal for linux, osx for osx).

It also builds using MSVC++ on Windows (squeezelite.vcxproj).

Examples

To build on linux with support for re sampling if the same tree was previously 
used to build with different options:

OPTS=-DRESAMPLE make clean

OPTS=-DRESAMPLE make
